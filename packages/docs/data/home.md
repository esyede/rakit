## Basic Knowledge

Welcome to the documentation page.
These documents are intended to serve both as a guide to get started and as a feature reference.

Although you can jump to any section and start learning, we recommend reading the documentation
sequentially to allow us to gradually build the concepts that will be used
in subsequent documents.

## What is Rakit?

Rakit is a simple and easy-to-learn PHP framework.
New users will enjoy the ease of development found in other popular PHP frameworks.

More experienced users will have the opportunity to modularize their code
in ways not possible with other frameworks.

Its flexibility allows your organization to update and shape applications over time
as needed, its expressiveness will allow you and your team to develop
concise and readable code.

## Application Structure

The directory structure is intentionally designed to be familiar to users of other frameworks.
Web applications of all shapes and sizes can be easily created using this structure,
similar to how they would be created in other frameworks.

Throughout our documentation, we will show the default locations for each component being discussed.
